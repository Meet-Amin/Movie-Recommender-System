        "This project aims to predict mental health conditions based on textual data collected from Reddit. Natural language processing techniques are applied to preprocess and extract meaningful features from user posts. Machine learning models are then trained to classify and predict potential mental health risks. The study demonstrates how social media data can be leveraged for early detection and awareness of mental health concerns.\n",
